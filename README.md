Final Report of Study Project "Protect your Privacy"


# Abstract

This document summarizes the ideation and development process of the GDPR-compliant
image anonymization platform, carried out as a study project collaboration between the
University of Osnabrück and LMIS, a company focused on industry-related research and
development in the field of artificial intelligence. Within a year, we developed a GDPR-compliant product, achieving the project’s goal: anonymization of personally identifiable
information in images. Specifically, the product can detect and de-identify persons, faces,
tattoos, vehicles, license plates, text, and computer screens. Six detection techniques (person, face, vehicle, license plate, text, and computer screen) and four anonymization techniques (masking, blurring, face, and tattoo anonymization) are combined to achieve these
results.
